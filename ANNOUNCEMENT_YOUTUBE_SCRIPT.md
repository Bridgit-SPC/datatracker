## [0:00-0:30] Opening Hook

**[Screen: Platform homepage]**

"We're building the next level of the internet — and we're launching Early Access today."

**[Cut to talking head]**

"I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to invite you to help build the next internet. This is your chance to shape the foundational rules that will guide how we govern the interface layer — where meaning, identity, and trust are formed. Your voice matters, and we need it now."

---

## [0:30-1:30] What is MLTF?

**[Screen: Visual diagram of meta-layer concept]**

"The current internet works at the technical level — data flows, servers connect, protocols communicate. But the next internet needs governance at the interface level — where people and AI interact, where meaning is created, where trust is built."

**[Screen: Platform demo - Documents page]**

"The MLTF Datatracker is our participatory platform for developing the foundational practices, terminology, and standards for the next internet. It's built on proven principles: rough consensus, transparency, and open participation. Anyone can contribute, and everyone's voice matters."

## [1:30-2:30] ML-Draft-001: The Foundation

**[Screen: ML-Draft-001 page]**

"We're starting with the most important document: **ML-Draft-001: Foundational Governance Practices**. This draft establishes how the MLTF itself will operate — it's essentially our constitution."

**[Screen: Scroll through document]**

"This document sets the rules for everything that follows: governance frameworks, desirable properties, terminology, substrate requirements, and pilot programs. Your input on this draft will shape the foundation for all future work."

**[Screen: Highlight key sections]**

"It covers things like:
- How we make decisions — rough consensus vs. formal voting
- Our document lifecycle — ML-Drafts becoming ML-RFCs
- Our commitment to transparency and permanent archiving
- Our two-year timeline and transition to a full Task Force"

## [2:30-3:30] How to Participate

**[Screen: Platform demo - Registration/Login]**

"Here's how you can participate. First, go to rfc.themetalayer.org and create a free account. Anyone can join — developers, governance professionals, community builders, or anyone who cares about the future of internet governance."

**[Screen: Navigate to ML-Draft-001 comments page]**

"Once you're in, read ML-Draft-001. Then, submit your comments. We're looking for thoughtful, substantive feedback that helps us refine the governance model. Quality matters more than quantity."

**[Screen: Show comment interface]**

"You can comment on specific sections, ask questions, suggest improvements, or share your perspective. All comments are visible to everyone, creating a transparent, collaborative process."

---

## [3:30-4:00] Why Your Participation Matters

**[Screen: Talking head]**

"This is Early Access — you're among the first to help build this. The first draft is always the most important because it sets the foundation. Your comments now will influence how we govern the meta-layer for years to come."

"We're measuring success by the depth and quality of community engagement. Each thoughtful comment helps us build consensus and refine our approach."

---

## [4:00-4:30] Timeline & Next Steps

**[Screen: Calendar/clock visual]**

"We're accepting comments on ML-Draft-001 for the next **two weeks**. This is a time-bound opportunity to shape the foundational document."

**[Screen: Roadmap visual]**

"After ML-Draft-001, we'll publish drafts on:
- Desirable Properties of the Meta-Layer
- Terminology and ontology
- Substrate requirements  
- Pilot programs"

"And anyone can submit their own drafts. This is an open, participatory process."
