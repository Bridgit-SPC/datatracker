# LinkedIn Announcement: MLTF Datatracker Early Access

**🚀 Help Build the Next Internet — MLTF Datatracker Early Access Now Open**

We're building the next level of the internet, and we need your voice to shape it.

Today, we're launching **Early Access** to the MLTF Datatracker — a participatory platform where we're developing the foundational practices, terminology, and standards that will govern the next internet. This is about the interface layer: where meaning, identity, trust, and human–agent interaction are formed.

**Why This Matters**

The current internet works at the technical level — data flows, protocols connect, servers communicate. But the next internet needs governance at the interface level — where people and AI interact, where meaning is created, where trust is built.

This isn't just about technology — it's about building a people-centered governance model that's transparent, inclusive, and regenerative.

**ML-Draft-001: Foundational Governance Practices**

We're starting with the most important document: **ML-Draft-001**, which establishes how the MLTF itself will operate. This draft sets the rules for all future work, including:
- Governance frameworks
- Desirable Properties of the Meta-Layer
- Terminology and ontology
- Substrate requirements
- Pilot programs

**Your Input Shapes the Foundation**

This is your chance to influence the foundational rules. We're seeking thoughtful, substantive comments that help refine our governance model. Quality engagement matters more than volume.

**How to Participate**

1. **Read ML-Draft-001**: [rfc.themetalayer.org/doc/draft/rbpa16we/](https://rfc.themetalayer.org/doc/draft/rbpa16we/)
2. **Create an account** (free, open to anyone)
3. **Submit your comments** — help us refine the governance framework
4. **Share your perspective** — technical, governance, or community-focused

**⏰ Two-Week Feedback Window**

We're accepting comments on ML-Draft-001 for the next two weeks. This is a time-bound opportunity to shape the foundational document.

**Who Should Participate?**

- Technical contributors building interface-layer infrastructure
- Governance and standards professionals
- Purpose-aligned community builders
- Anyone who cares about the future of internet governance

**What's Next?**

After ML-Draft-001, we'll publish drafts on:
- Desirable Properties of the Meta-Layer
- Terminology and ontology
- Substrate requirements
- Pilot programs

**Join Us**

This is early access — you're among the first to help build the next level of the internet. Your voice shapes the foundation.
